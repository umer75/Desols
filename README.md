## Approach and Assumptions

### Custom Post Type
Used `register_post_type()` to manage employees as a separate entity. The post type is set to private (`public: false`) but accessible in the admin (`show_ui: true`).

### Meta Fields
Created meta boxes for storing additional employee data (name, email, salary, etc.) and used post meta to store these values securely. Data is sanitized during save to ensure safety.

### Admin Report Page
A custom admin submenu was added under the "Employees" section. It lists all employees using `WP_Query`, sorted by selected meta values. Averages are intended to be calculated client-side or via AJAX (future enhancement).

### CSV Export
Used `wp_nonce_field` for security and outputted all employee data in CSV format directly to the browser. Chose raw SQL for speed and control during export, with sanitization for output.

### Assumptions
- Only administrators or users with `manage_options` capability can access the report and export features.
- Plugin is only used in the admin area; there is no frontend display.
- Basic styling is sufficient; no custom CSS was added beyond WordPress defaults.
